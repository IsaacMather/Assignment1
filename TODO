okay so we need to see what kind of n values for fibonacci recursive and
fibonacci direct need doing. Can we do 1500 with fibonacci direct? We should
find out

we need to graph the time comparison for each of these things, and put them in
a chart, and then do a write up of the performance of one vs the other in
emperical and mathematical complexity
