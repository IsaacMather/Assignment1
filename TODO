first algo you can count loops, second, use an argument similar to towers of
hanoi, third is a bit tricky!


so need to update the argument for the second one to towers of hanoi, and
update the final argument to make sure i have the right mathematical complexity



okay so we need to see what kind of n values for fibonacci recursive and
fibonacci direct need doing. Can we do 1500 with fibonacci direct? We should
find out

we need to graph the time comparison for each of these things, and put them in
a chart, and then do a write up of the performance of one vs the other in
emperical and mathematical complexity


#so oddly enough i redid the program

one other thing to be cautious of... timeit will not reset the lru_cache for
each run. For memo, you may want to create a wrapper function that resets the
cache and then calls the fibonacci_memo functon

if you saw seeing that the function scales linaraly, that *factor* increase
should be some what constant for each function, with some bumps where you mihgt
 hit some resource issues.

 Comparing functions, however, ou should not see the same factor increae. You
 should find that one scales well, one does not, and a third requires a little
 thought
